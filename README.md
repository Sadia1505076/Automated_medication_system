This is a microcontroller project.
This is  a system to help elderly people with their medications.We used RTC to create an alarm system, keypad to enter a predefined time,
stepper motor to open the lid of the box containing the medicines, buzzer to buzz at the predefined time and a sensor to know if the user is near the system to take the medicines.
